# Unit 2 | Homework Assignment: Automate Your Day Job with Python

## PyBank

In this activity, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. I was provided with a financial dataset in the file: budget_data.csv. This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


The total number of months included in the dataset.


The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.


The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.


The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.


The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.



The final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
